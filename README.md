# Directed-Graph
Made with a school collegue [Kasra](https://github.com/kasrarad).

It can create two types of graph: directed and undirected. Graphs are composed of nodes and nodes can be linked together
to form an edge. They can be of any types.

Read the wiki (https://github.com/DPigeon/Directed-Graph/wiki) to know more about it.
